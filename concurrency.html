				<h4>My Role</h4>
				<p>I was the UX Lead working to define the experience strategy, perform a content audit, create and present deliverables to stakeholders, design and test the new information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, style guide creation, and usability testing the final responsive design.</p>
				<p><small><strong>The Team:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/emery-ullenberg/12/741/38">Emery Ullenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.jontetzlaff.com">Jon Tetzlaff</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/keith-donnell/13/438/231">Keith Donnell</a></small></p>

				<h4>The Challenge</h4>
				<p>Create a responsive site that cleverly explains a highly-complex suite of products and technologies in a way that's both helpful for those not-in-the-know, and useful for expert technologists.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="project-block">
				<h4>The Research</h4><!--
				<p>It's a rare thing for a design studio to work with a client that shares so much in common with them. Because <a href="http://concurrency.com">Concurrency</a> provides similar technology solutions, they also run similar operations internally. We worked with their UX Designers to define the current and goal audience.</p>-->

				<h3>Workshopping</h3>
				<p>Our initial discovery kickoff with Concurrency had us running goal exploration, persona creation, and stakeholder alignment exercises to construct the initial hypothesis that would drive our research.</p>

				<h3>Persona Development</h3>
				<p>After the workshop, I sat down to research Concurrency's user behavior patterns, motivations and goals through phone interviews and ethnographic research. We ended on three main characters: The Owner, The Technologist, and The Candidate.</p>
				<p>Concurrency has been growing at a rapid pace, so making sure the site was alluring to possible candidates and graduates was a high-priority. Proving they were thought-leaders and demonstrating  large-scale, carefully executed solutions that stood out to possible decisions makers was a must.</p>

				<h3>Content Audit</h3>
				<p>Before the process of restructuring any site begins, we perform a Content Audit on the current site, app, or system. This allows the team to find large content holes, uncomfortable flows, and realize the scope of the project.</p>
				<figure class="t-2 b-2">

				</figure>


				<h3>Information Architecture / Sitemap</h3>
				<p>After mapping the system, running tree tests and card sorts with team members, stakeholders, and current users, we reorganized the structure and visualized the flow. This low-cost deliverable allows everyone to instantly grasp the scope of the project and guides discussions with the engineers and designers.</p>

				<h4>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h4>
				<p>Usually we'll begin the process with sketches and brainstorming, but because that had all been done earlier in the process, I jumped into <a href="http://uxpin.com" target="_blank">UXPin</a> to wire up the sitemap and get a good feel for the flow of the site.</p>
				<p>I then iterated through the wireframe templates, redefining areas, and working with the client and content strategist to flesh out content, simplify user flows, and adding more relavant content to help guide the user.</p>
				<p>At this point in the process, we'll usually begin to add realistic content and copy to help the client define the sites voice. It's also the only way to really know if the templates will hold up to real-life content.</p>

				<h4>Visual Design</h4>
				<p>During the prototyping process, I'll work with the Producer and Designer to help communicate the mood of the site. We use Element Collages and Mood Boards to quickly define and iterate the look and feel without spending too much time on exact templates or pages.</p>

				<h3>Style Guide</h3>
				<p>After the client has approved visual design, I'll work with the designer to create Style Guides and Pattern Libraries for each project depending on complexity and budget.</p>
				<p>This allows for much easier feature development in the future. New designers and front-end developers can then use detailed prototypes, which are much quicker to produce, and style guides to develop new features without a heavy cost to the original designers time.</p>

				<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
				<p>All of our designs need to work across an almost infinite array of screen sizes and pixel-densities. We work through Alpha and Beta cycles to produce functional prototypes that can be tested with real users before launch.</p>

				<h4>Post-Launch</h4>
				<p>After launch, it's my job to watch Google Analytics, Crazy Egg, VWO, Optimizely, or any related heat-mapping software to track interactions, scroll patterns, exit points, and goal conversion ratios.</p>
				<p>Around two weeks to a month, I'll begin A/B testing certain features of the site and run usability tests, with the goal of collecting quantitative and qualitative data with the aim to focus development time on the second phase or iteration of the site or app.</p>
				<p>There are many methods used to obtain real data and drive successful redesigns. This is one version of the process.</p>
				<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
